# Terraform Infrastructure Examples
This repo contains example Terraform configurations for different infrastructure needs. 
The goal of this repo is to provide simple, readable examples that promote [Terraform Best Practices](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/guides/recommended-practices/index.html). 


## Usage
For demonstration purposes, each example in this repository can be executed as its own standalone Terraform configuration. 
In production or production-like settings, it's expected that users copy+paste these example configurations and update them as they see fit.
